## Description

The "work in progress" website for the popular Mandalorian Armor Etsy shop, Caniafe Ordo Forges. The basic functionality of the commerce website is complete with users being able to add items to the cart and being able to checkout and pay with a credit card. All of Canaife's products have been added to the CommerceJS API and we plan on expanding the product list with variations and customization features. When testing the checkout process, please use card number 4242424242424242 with any valid future date, any three-digit CVC, and any user value you would like for the rest of the checkout form fields. 

## Technologies Used

* React.js
* CommerceJS
* Stripe Payment API
* Material UI

## Future Plans

I'm currently in the process of working on other branches where I'll be styling the website to fit Caniafe Ordo Forge's brand. I'm going to add product pages so the user can better customize the armor and have a contact page so that they can directly communicate with Caniafe. I also want to learn how to add other payment methods like Klarna as requested by the client.
